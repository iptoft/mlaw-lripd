<br><br>
You are not required to hold an insolvency practitioner’s licence if you do not intend to undertake insolvency officeholder appointments under the Act, and ***only*** intend to continue with and complete the administration of the cases commenced under the Bankruptcy Act (Cap. 20) and / or Companies Act (Cap. 50) under your care.
