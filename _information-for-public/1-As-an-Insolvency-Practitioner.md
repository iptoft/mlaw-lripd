Under the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act 2018 (“the Act”), an insolvency practitioner’s licence is required if an individual wishes to undertake the following appointment(s):
<br><br> 
⦁	Liquidator or provisional liquidator of the corporation;
<br>
⦁	Judicial manager or interim judicial manager of the corporation;

<br>
⦁	Trustee of a bankrupt’s estate; or
<br>
⦁	Nominee of a voluntary arrangement. 
<br><br>
Section 48(1) of the Act prohibits any person from acting as an insolvency practitioner in relation to a corporation or an individual, or advertising, or in any way holding out, that he or she is willing to act as an insolvency practitioner in relation to a corporation or an individual without a license.
<br><br>
Any person found contravening or acting to the contrary shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both.
<br><br>
An insolvency practitioner’s licence is <u>not</u> required if a person:
<br>
a)       wishes to be appointed as a liquidator in a members’ voluntary winding up case, or a scheme manager in a scheme of arrangement case commenced under the Act; or
<br>
b)      intends to <u>only</u> administer insolvency or debt restructuring cases which had commenced under the Bankruptcy Act (Cap. 20) and / or Companies Act (Cap. 50).
<br><br>
**Transition to the Act**
<br><br>
Section 527(1) of the Act provides a 6-month transitional period (effective from  30 June 2020 to 29 December 2020) that allows a person to undertake insolvency or debt-restructuring work commenced under the Act <u>without holding an insolvency practitioner’s licence</u>,  **provided** that he / she possesses the necessary qualifications to do the same under the Companies Act (Cap. 50) and / or Bankruptcy Act (Cap. 20):
<br><br>
* **Scenario 1:** If you are an approved liquidator registered with ACRA but not a public accountant, you will only be allowed to undertake appointments in winding up and receivership cases commenced under the Act.
<br>
 
* **Scenario 2:** If you are a public accountant, you will only be allowed to undertake appointments in judicial management, bankruptcy and voluntary arrangement cases commenced under the Act.
<br> 

* **Scenario 3:** If you are a qualified solicitor, you will only be allowed to undertake appointments in bankruptcy or voluntary arrangement cases commenced under the Act.
<br><br>
However, at the end of the transitional period, a person must hold an insolvency practitioner’s licence in order to administer new and / or existing insolvency or debt-restructuring cases commenced under the Act.
